Brand new idea: For my final project, I am going to create a system that teachers can use to track information regarding class field trips.
- In the program, one or more teachers will be able to set up one more class sections with one or more trips.
- In each section, a given roster of students and their demographics can be provided.
- For each trip, a teacher will be able to pull destination information from foursquare.
- For each trip, a teacher can generate permission slips and "invoices" for payment amounts.
- The parents of students will be able to log-in to the site and view their student's information and permission request and amount due.
- Parents will be able to pay for the trip online using credit cards with integration with stripe.
- Parents will be able to provide permission via digital signature from hellosign
- Teachers will be able to view, modify permission and payment status if not received and indicate paper permission and check/cash received.

xFor my final project I want to build a special CRM...

Update 9/17/2014:
APIs I would be interested in including:
Pull in facebook info for venue and or artists
Pull in Google Maps location info for venues
Interface with mailing list system (i.e. mailchimp) for sending out mailing list messages.
Pull in Linkedin information on venue contacts
For creation of contacts- api with digital signature system for sharing/signing contracts.

Update 8/9/2014:
This CRM will be able to be utilized by entertainment and performing arts booking agencies.
It will be able to track the following types of information:
-Performance Groups
-Performance Group Contacts
-Venues
-Spaces within Venues
-Venue Contacts
-Notes/Communications between Agent and Venue and Group
-Performance Dates/Contract Info
-Booking Agent (Users)
-User Rights

Nice to create: export performance dates/contract info into predefined contract template.
