For my final project I want to build a special CRM...

Update 8/9/2014:
This CRM will be able to be utilized by entertainment and performing arts booking agencies.
It will be able to track the following types of information:
-Performance Groups
-Performance Group Contacts
-Venues
-Spaces within Venues
-Venue Contacts
-Notes/Communications between Agent and Venue and Group
-Performance Dates/Contract Info
-Booking Agent (Users)
-User Rights

Nice to create: export performance dates/contract info into predefined contract template.
