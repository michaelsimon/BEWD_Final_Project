For my final project I want to build a special CRM...

Update 9/17/2014:
APIs I would be interested in including:
Pull in facebook info for venue and or artists
Pull in Google Maps location info for venues
Interface with mailing list system (i.e. mailchimp) for sending out mailing list messages.
Pull in Linkedin information on venue contacts
For creation of contacts- api with digital signature system for sharing/signing contracts.

Update 8/9/2014:
This CRM will be able to be utilized by entertainment and performing arts booking agencies.
It will be able to track the following types of information:
-Performance Groups
-Performance Group Contacts
-Venues
-Spaces within Venues
-Venue Contacts
-Notes/Communications between Agent and Venue and Group
-Performance Dates/Contract Info
-Booking Agent (Users)
-User Rights

Nice to create: export performance dates/contract info into predefined contract template.
